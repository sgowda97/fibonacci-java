Fibonacci Series using recursive function and non-recursive function


# What is fibonacci series?
Here, the next number is the sum of previous two numbers. The first two numbers are always 0 and 1.

# HOW-TO

- Fibonacci series can be achieved in two ways:
	- Recursive
	- Non-recursive
- A method which keeps calling itself is called recursive
- Assuming you want to use non-recursive, while in the directory in CLI, type: 
	- javac FibonacciSeries.java
	- java FibonacciSeries
- Follow the instructions
